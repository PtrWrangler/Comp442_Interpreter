Work Log:
	questions to ask:
	- In the <idnest> production theres was a '.' and i was not sure what
	it meant so I just removed it

Mar 17th, 2017
    Over the past week I have:
    - fully switched to a Table Predictive Parsing
    - Fixed my grammar

Mar 17th-20th, 2017
    done:
	for parsing the PPT_grammar into object, need to check if EPSILON in the production line, if not then in the first set because it may be in there resulting in it having both a first and follow set.

	I think I will force program function to be the last function in the code
        all classes and free functions must be declared before it.
    a class can only declare variables and functions
    a function can declare/assign variables, use (class/free) functions, use expressions
    program behaves like a function but there is only one (main program) and it must be at the end.

	I realized I had been using indice for variable declaration and assignmnent, but for decl I need to be using arraySize which forces integer index and cannot be an expression inside the [].
	- arraySize -> [ INT ] arraySize

	error recovery now is done with syncronizing tokens ;, }, {
	its not enough though maybe if each production had its own set…

done:
    - do not tolower() all incoming tokens in scanner
	- Parsing the PPT_grammar into objects
    - Force program function to be the last function in the code
        all classes and free functions must be declared before it, in that order.

    Before I was reating a dummy entry as I waited for the attribute migration but I saw that was not working.
    now I am using the stack method, I had to realise there are not supposed to be any semantic processor errors to catch, if there is a problem it is with the grammar or the coding. you should be popping what you are expecting to pop on the attr_stack.

    - FIXED. in the entry type for a function that passes a array parameter, the indexes are saving backwards.
    - FIXED. Broken SymbolTable search
