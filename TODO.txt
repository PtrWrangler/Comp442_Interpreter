todo:
	finish reading the the slides 5, 6
	apply a new table driven parser
	
	script to parse PPT_Grammar into object
	create parsing table from object
	implement the parser

A3 look over:
	for parsing the PPT_grammar into object, need to check if EPSILON in the production line, if not then in the first set because it may be in there resulting in it having both a first and follow set.
	
A2 look over:
    in factor it is figuratively a int/float
    in arithExpr it is figuratively a int/float

    in type it is a litteral 'int'/'float'

    a var decl can have a either float/int or id type. also no type at all listed if youve already created it in memory and are just referencing it... must go back and edit the grammar again...

    added a ; to end of varorfunc?

**  added a followSet to aParams, please check kfgedit and update
    indice         -> [ arithExpr ] indice
                  | . indice | EPSILON
        addded . to vardecltail

    expr first: 'space ,' error

    paramsorindice elif ?

    a func decl can only have 1 level idnest?
