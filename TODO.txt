todo:
	finish reading the the slides 5, 6
	apply a new table driven parser
	
	script to parse PPT_Grammar into object
	create parsing table from object
	implement the parser

A3 look over:
    todo:
    - do not tolower all incoming tokens in scanner
    - implement errors
    - nicely display 2d table for debug?

    - no need for sub scope (new semantic table) when creating for or if statements

    semantic errors to be caught:
    - circular dependancy of class variables
    - using a variable before it is defined.
    - duplicate variable definition (in same scope)


    arraySize changed int to INT


    done:
	for parsing the PPT_grammar into object, need to check if EPSILON in the production line, if not then in the first set because it may be in there resulting in it having both a first and follow set.

	I think I will force program function to be the last function in the code
        all classes and free functions must be declared before it.
    a class can only declare variables and functions
    a function can declare/assign variables, use (class/free) functions, use expressions
    program behaves like a function but there is only one (main program) and it must be at the end.
	
	I realized I had been using indice for variable declaration and assignmnent, but for decl I need to be using arraySize which forces integer index and cannot be an expression inside the [].
	- arraySize -> [ INT ] arraySize



A2 look over:
    in factor it is figuratively a int/float
    in arithExpr it is figuratively a int/float

    in type it is a litteral 'int'/'float'

    a var decl can have a either float/int or id type. also no type at all listed if youve already created it in memory and are just referencing it... must go back and edit the grammar again...

    added a ; to end of varorfunc?

**  added a followSet to aParams, please check kfgedit and update
    indice         -> [ arithExpr ] indice
                  | . indice | EPSILON
        addded . to vardecltail

    expr first: 'space ,' error

    paramsorindice elif ?

    a func decl can only have 1 level idnest?
