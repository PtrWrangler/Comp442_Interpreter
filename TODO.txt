todo:
	finish reading the the slides 5, 6
	apply a new table driven parser

look over:
    in factor it is figuratively a int/float
    in arithExpr it is figuratively a int/float

    in type it is a litteral 'int'/'float'

    a var decl can have a either float/int or id type. also no type at all listed if youve already created it in memory and are just referencing it... must go back and edit the grammar again...

    added a ; to end of varorfunc?

**  added a followSet to aParams, please check kfgedit and update
    indice         -> [ arithExpr ] indice
                  | . indice | EPSILON
        addded . to vardecltail

    expr first: 'space ,' error

    paramsorindice elif ?

    a func decl can only have 1 level idnest?
